## Introduction

GebeyaHUB is an innovative website created by Nathan Assefa Kassa and Mahlet Seifu Feleke to revolutionize shopping and trading in Ethiopia. We developed it as a project for Holberton School to showcase our web development skills.

The Online Store is a web application designed to provide a platform for users to browse and purchase products online. It offers a user-friendly interface that allows customers to search for products and add them to their cart.

## Features

- User authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out.
- Product browsing: Users can view a list of products, search for specific products, and view detailed information about each product.
- Shopping cart: Users can add products to their cart, modify the quantity, and remove items.

## Personal Motivation

The GebeyaHUB project came from our desire to demonstrate our abilities and apply what we had learned in the past 10 months. We had several project ideas but decided to create an e-commerce website because it was relevant and had the potential to make a difference in the Ethiopian market. This project served as proof of our skills and a way to address the challenges faced by businesses and consumers in our country.
